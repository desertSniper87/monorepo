## Sample Ecommerce site Backend

This is a example backend of a ecommerce site created using django rest framework. There is [frontend](https://github.com/desertSniper87/maalamaal_REST) made using html, jquery and mustache.

Web facing API is live at [heroku](http://maalamaal-rest-api.herokuapp.com/).

### How to run

#### Linux

It's a standard django site. 

1. Clone the repo. 
2. create virtualenv
    ```bash 
        python3 -m virtualenv env
    ```
3. Activate virtualenv 
    ```bash
       source env/bin/activate
    ```
4. If you use postgres then Create a database `maalamaal_rest`
 with the same username and password
 otherwise change database settings in `lab_test_rest/settings.py` 
 and then migrate by `./manage.py migrate`
5. Run server. `./manage.py runserver`

#### NixOS
I have included a `build.nix`. So running `build-nix` will create `@result` and you will be able to 
create virtualenv based on this
```bash
./result/bin/python3 -m virtualenv env
```
