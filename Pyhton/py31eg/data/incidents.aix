STATEMENT FEBRUARY 6, 2007: TOGETHER WITH INSPECTORS ^PRIVACY DATA
OMITTED^ , I ^PRIVACY DATA OMIT^ ASSISTED IN PERFORMING AN INCIDENT
INVESTIGATION ON N694T AT PADUCAH AIRPORT (KPAH), KENTUCKY, ON
FEBRUARY 5, 2007 . AN INSPECTION OF THE MAIN AUXILIARY FUEL TANK FOR
WATER CONTAMINATION WAS PERFORMED, THE FOLLOWING WAS OBSERVED: THE
AIRCRAFT'S LEFT AND RIGHT MAIN FUEL TANKS SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF WATER
CONTAMINATION. AN ATTEMPT TO GET A SAMPLE FROM THE LEFT AUXILIARY FUEL
TANK INDICATED THAT THE TANK WAS EMPTY. A SAMPLE OF THE RIGHT
AUXILIARY FUEL TANK WAS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO A STUCK SUMP DRAIN. AN
ATTEMPT TO UNFREEZE THE DRAIN WAS MADE BY A MECHANIC FROM MIDWEST
AVIATION AND WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. POWER WAS SUPPLIED TO THE AIRCRAFT TO
GET AN INDICATION OF THE FUEL QUANTITY GAUGES. THE FUEL QUANTITY
GAUGES INDICATED THAT THE LEFT AND RIGHT MAIN FUEL TANKS WERE EMPTY
AND THE AUXILIARY LEFT AND RIGHT TANKS SHOWED HALF FULL. I ASKED THE
PILOT IF HE SUMPED ALL TANKS PRIOR TO SATURDAY'S FLIGHT, HE STATED
THAT HE ALWAYS CHECKS THE MAIN TANKS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE AUXILIARY
TANKS HE DID NOT RESPOND WITH AN ANSWER. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE
ENGINES WERE RUNNING FINE ON LANDING. ANALYSIS: THE PILOT ^PRIVACY
DATA OM^ THE PILOT OF N694T DID NOT COMPLETE A PROPER PREFLIGHT WHEN
HE NEGLECTED TO SUMP ALL THE FUEL TANKS. THE PILOT ^PRIVACY DA^ ALSO
DEPARTED THE AIRPORT WITH A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF FUEL IN THE MAIN FUEL
TANKS. (THE FLIGHT LASTED APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES, THE FUEL
INDICATION AFTER THE CRASH MAINS EMPTY, AUX TANKS ONE HALF FULL). THE
PILOT ^PRIVACY DATA OM^ STATED THAT THE ENGINES DID NOT SOUND RIGHT.
THE AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN PARKED OUTSIDE IN FRIGID TEMPERATURES, THERE IS
THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE WERE NOT UP TO
OPERATING TEMPERATURE. THIS COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE PROPELLERS FROM
GOING TO FINE PITCH WHICH WOULD GIVE A DIFFERENT SOUND THAN FINE PITCH
AT FULL POWER. THIS WOULD ALSO ACCOUNT WHY THE ENGINES SOUNDED OK ON
LANDING AFTER THE OIL TEMPERATURE REACHED THE NORMAL OPERATING RANGE.
ON LANDING, BOTH PROPELLERS CONTACTED THE RUNWAY AT THE SAME TIME.
THIS INDICATES THAT A NOSE DOWN LANDING WAS ATTEMPTED OR THE NOSE GEAR
COLLAPSED. BOTH PROPELLERS WERE SEVERELY BENT INDICATING THAT THE
ENGINES WERE TURNING AT HIGH POWER. CONCLUSION: ^PRIVACY DATA OMITTED^

STUDENT HAD THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND ON A CROSSWIND TAKE OFF, THE RIGHT
WING TIP CONTACTED THE GROUND, THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR INTERVENED BUT
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WAS LOST AND GLIDERS LEFT WING STRUCK A FENCE POST
BEFORE COMING TO A STOP. PILOT STATEMENT: DURING A CURRENCY-TRAINING
LESSON ON MARCH5 2007 WITH A CUSTOMER (PRIVATE PILOT-GLIDER, ^PRIVACY
DATA OM^) I FAILED TO MAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS QUICK ENOUGH AFTER I
ABORTED THE TAKEOFF IN A SGS 2-33 GLIDER (N7763S), WHICH RESULTED IN
DAMAGE TO THE GLIDER. THESE ARE THE EVENTS AS I REMEMBER; AFTER A PRE-
FLIGHT BRIEFING AND PRE-FLIGHT, WE POSITIONED THE GLIDER ON A TAKEOFF
RAMP FOR RUNWAY 26. THE TOW PILOT TAXIED INTO POSITION AND WE
COMPLETED A PRE-TAKEOFF CHECK. WE HAD A CROSSWIND FROM THE SOUTH
(10-15 KNOTS). THE LINE PERSON ATTACHED THE ROPE AND THEN POSITIONED
THE GLIDER FOR THE CROSSWIND TAKEOFF (UPWIND WING LOW). IN THIS CASE
THE LEFT WING WAS HELD LOW. I POSITIONED THE CONTROLS FOR THE STUDENT
AND REITERATED THE CROSSWIND TECHNIQUE AND ASSURED HER THAT I WOULD
TAKE OVER THE CONTROLS IF SHE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE TAKEOFF. I
TRANSFERRED THE CONTROLS TO HER, AND TOLD HER TO SIGNAL THE TOW PILOT
WHEN SHE WAS READY TO START THE TAKEOFF. AFTER THE SIGNAL FOR "GO" THE
TOW PILOT POWERED UP RAPIDLY. THIS CAUSED THE NOSE OF THE GLIDER TO
PITCH UP DURING THE INITIAL PART OF THE TAKEOFF ROLL. THE LINE PERSON
(WING RUNNER) LET GO OF THE WING AND THE STUDENT RELAXED THE CONTROLS
AND FAILED TO HOLD THE CROSSWIND CORRECTION AT WHICH POINT THE
DOWNWIND WING (RIGHT) CAME TO THE GROUND AND THE GLIDER STARTED TO
VEER SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT. I TOOK CONTROL OF THE GLIDER; FIRST PUT IN
CORRECTIONS TO REMEDY THE SITUATION WHEN I REALIZED I COULD NOT GAIN
CONTROL OF THE GLIDER I PULLED THE RELEASE AND ABORTED THE TAKEOFF. I
CONTINUED TO TRY TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE GLIDER AS IT CONTINUED TO VEER
TO THE RIGHT AND PULLED THE BRAKES BEFORE THE WINGTIP STRUCK A PARKED
GOLF CART. THE RIGHT WING TIP STRUCK THE PARKED GOLF CART CAUSING THE
GLIDER TO ROTATE FURTHER AND THE LEFT WING TO STRIKE A BARRIER POLE
NEAR THE PARKING LOT AREA. NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THIS ACCIDENT. THE
GLIDER NEVER BECAME AIRBORNE AND THIS OCCURRED WITHIN THE FIRST TWO
HUNDRED FEET OF THE TAKEOFF ROLL. STUDENT PILOT STATEMENT: ^PRIVACY
DATA O^ SUGGESTED I WRITE TO YOU IN REGARDS TO THE INCIDENT THAT
HAPPENED ON MONDAY, MARCH 5, 2007. MY NAME IS ^PRIVACY DAT^ AND I AM
THE STUDENT THAT WAS IN THE 2-33 WITH HER. THE WINDS AT THE TIME WERE
OUT OF THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AND WE WERE ON THE TAKEOFF RAMP FOR RUNWAY
26. AS THE TOWPLANE STARTED PULLING THE GLIDER ONTO THE RUNWAY, THE
RIGHT WING DROPPED AND THE GLIDER STARTED VEERING TO THE RIGHT.
^PRIVA^ PULLED THE RELEASE OF THE GLIDER AND TOOK CONTROL, BUT IT KEPT
MOVING. SHE MANAGED TO STEER THE NOSE OF THE GLIDER AWAY FROM THE
FENCEPOST, BUT THE LEFT WING HIT THE FENCEPOST AS THE GLIDER CAME TO A
STOP. NEITHER SHE NOR I WERE HURT, HOWEVER THERE IS DAMAGE TO THE
WINGS OF THE 2-33. EVERYTHING HAPPENED VERY FAST AND I AM SORRY I
CANNOT FILL YOU IN WITH MORE DETAILS. I AM SURE ^PRIVA^ DID THE BEST

AT APPROXIMATELY 2105L, THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2007 AN AIRTRAN AIRWAYS
B-717-200 AIRCRAFT STRUCK A STATIONARY GALLEY SERVICE TRUCK DURING
PUSHBACK FROM GATE D-1 AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD-JACKSON INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT. THE AIRCRAFT SUFFERED MINOR DAMAGE TO THE LEFT WING TIP AND
NAVIGATION LIGHTS. NO INJURIES OCCURRED AND THE PASSENGERS TRANSFERRED
TO ANOTHER AIRCRAFT. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD
RECEIVED PROPER CLEARANCE FOR PUSHBACK FOR RAMP 4 TOWER AND WAS UNDER
THE CONTROL OF AN ADEQUATELY TRAINED AND QUALIFIED AIRTRAN TUG DRIVER
WITH TWO REQUIRED WING-WALKER ASSISTANTS. ACCORDING TO PROCEDURES, THE
PIC HAD ILLUMINATED THE ANTI-COLLISION LIGHT INDICATING THE AIRCRAFT
WAS TO BEGIN MOVEMENT. NEITHER PILOT HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE GALLEY
SERVICE TRUCK DURING ANY PART OF THE PUSH-BACK OPERATION UNTIL THEY
FELT A JOLT AND ADVISED THAT THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THE PIC'S STATED
THE AIRCRAFT WAS LOCATED ON GATE D1A, WHICH IS THE LABELING ON THE
OUTSIDE OF THE JETWAY, BUT THE ACTUAL GATE IS D1 AS CORRECTLY LABELED
IN THE TERMINAL BUILDING. WRITTEN STATEMENTS DESCRIBE THE PUSHBACK
BEGINNING AND BOTH WING-WALKERS HAD REPOSITIONED THEMSELVES TO THE
REAR AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO CLEAR THE PATH ACROSS THE
RAMP ROADWAY ACCORDING TO THEIR PROCEDURES. THE SERVICE TRUCK THEN
ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE BETWEEN THIS AIRCRAFT AND AN AIRCRAFT PARKED AT THE
NEIGHBORING GATE, D-1A. THE GALLEY SERVICE TRUCK DRIVER REPORTED THAT
ONCE HIS TRUCK VISUALLY CLEARED THE LEFT WINGTIP OF THE INCIDENT
AIRCRAFT, HE STOPPED TO ALLOW HIS OWN GUIDE/PASSENGER TO REBOARD THE
SERVICE TRUCK. THE LEFT WING-WALKER SUBSEQUENTLY NOTICED THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY OF THE CATERING TRUCK, THEN HURRIED FORWARD TO VISUALLY
(CROSSED LIGHTED WANDS) AND AUDIBLY (SHOUTS) WARN THE TUG DRIVER OF
IMPENDING COLLISION. THE TUG DRIVER REPORTED OBSERVING THE WING-
WALKER'S WARNING AND IMMEDIATELY APPLIED THE TUG BRAKES TO STOP BUT
WITH UNSUFFICIENT TIME TO AVERT STRIKING THE LEFT AND REAR WING-
TIP/POSITION LIGHT AREA. AIRTRAN AIRWAY'S CORPORATE SAFETY DEPARTMENT
INVESTIGATED THIS INCIDENT, COLLECTING STATEMENTS FROM THE INDIVIDUALS
INVOLVED AND WILL BE FORWARDING THEIR CONCLUSION IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

PILOT SIMULATED AN ENGINE FAILURE AT ALTITUDE ON AN INSTRUCTIONAL
FLIGHT, COULD NOT RESTART ENGINE. PILOT CONTACTED MONTGOMERY AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER FOR LANDING CLEARANCE, AND LANDED WITHOUT
FURTHER INCIDENT. PILOT STATEMENT ATTACHED. REPORT WILL BE AMENDED
WHEN PILOT APPEARS FOR LOGBOOK INSPECTION ON JANUARY 2, 2008. PILOT'S
STATEMENT: ON 11-15-2007, I WAS CONDUCTING AN INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT FOR
A COMMERCIAL MULTI ENGINE CANDIDATE IN N15068 A PA-34. MY STUDENT
«PRIVACY DATA OMITTED» WAS BRIEFED ON OEI, AND OTHER FACTORS AND
CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING OEI AND FULLY FEATHERING AND RESTARTING
PROCEDURES. JUST NE OF "NESTY" INTERSECTION AT ABOUT 3500' MSL I
FAILED THE PORT SIDE ENGINE USING THE MIXTURE KNOB. MY STUDENT WENT
THROUGH A TROUBLE SHOOT FLOW AND THEN A SHUT DOWN FLOW, OMITTING THE
SHUT DOWN OF MAGS, FUEL AND X-FEEDING. I ALLOWED MY STUDENT TO FLY THE
AIRCRAFT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES WITH THE FEATHERED ENGINE. I THEN DID A
FLIGHT CONTROL EXCHANGE AND TOLD HER TO RE-START USING THE "HOT START"
CHECK LIST. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO RE-START, I GAVE HER THE FLIGHT
CONTROL AND ATTEMPTED A FLOODED ENGINE START AFTER NOTICING THAT THE
FUEL PUMP WAS "ON" THE FAILED ENGINE. THE  STARTER ENGAGED MOMENTARILY
AND THEN QUIT. AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT THAT TWO THINGS HAD HAPPENED.
THE ENGINE WAS FLOODED AND THE SERIES WOUND STARTER MOTOR WAS OVER
HEATED AND WOULD NOT CRANK. I CONSIDERED THAT I HAD THE FOLLOWING
OPTIONS: 1. LOITER AT 3500' FEET IN A HEAVY TRAFFIC AREA FOR UP TO 15
TO 20 MINUTES (SINGLE ENGINE) UNTIL THE STARTER MOTOR COOLED OFF AND
HOPE FOR A RESTART. 2. ASK FOR PRIORITY HANDLING, GET ON THE ILS AND
LAND IT. 3. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY IF I COULD NOT GET PRIORITY HANDLING
AND LAND IT. I ASKED FOR AND WAS GIVEN PRIORITY TO THE RUNWAY. I
BRIEFED MY STUDENT AND SHE MADE A NEAR PERFECT SINGLE ENGINE APPROACH
AND LANDING.
