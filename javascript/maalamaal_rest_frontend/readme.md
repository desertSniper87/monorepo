### Sample Ecommerce site fronted

This is a example frontend to [a Django REST ecommerce backend](https://github.com/desertSniper87/maalamaal_REST) made using html, jquery and mustache.

Site is live at [netlify](https://maalamaal.netlify.com/).

#### How to run

##### Locally

The site is wholly static with all js and css included. Run a simple webserver using npm or python.

For example, make sure you have `simpleserver` installed and then `cd` into the project source root and run, 

```bash
python3 -m http.server $PORT
```

##### In server

This is a static site so put source root in any www/public-www facing folder in any server.

#### Todo (In order of Decreasing priority)

- [ ] Fix footer on all pages. 
- [ ] Use a html template rendering engine.
- [ ] Password validation on clientside
- [ ] Port this to Vue/React.
