<p>It seems like yesterday that the &#8217;80s was the surprise comeback decade of colorful t-shirts and <a href="http://www.brokelyn.com/saturday-cartoons-make-a-comeback-this-weekend-with-booze/" target="_self">hipster-laden Saturday morning cereal parties</a>. Well, welcome back, &#8217;90s. It&#8217;s your turn. And it&#8217;s all about the music. This Friday, Jul. 9, celebrate the decade at the 90s Sing-Along Episode III: Return of the Mack at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/legion-brooklyn" target="_self">Legion</a> in Williamsburg (<a href="http://livingfreenyc.com/?p=7455" target="_self">part deux</a> was back in April). The free sing-along, which will have so much more than the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twgArtVqMlM" target="_self">promised Mark Morrison</a>, boasts &#8220;2.5 hours of nonstop, heart warming, fist pumping, boy band dancing, cheesy rap booty shaking and  angst filled shouting music videos.&#8221; And it wouldn&#8217;t be a real &#8217;90s night without a Hip Hop dance-off.<span id="more-19364"></span></p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be no mics and no requests, but just some big screens with the &#8217;90s videos and subtitles so everyone can sing together. The dance-off will be for prizes from Brother Jimmy&#8217;s Restaurant/Bar (and more), and there&#8217;ll be a &#8217;90s costume contest going on somewhere in there too. For drinks: $3 Atomic Lager and $5 Tecate &amp; a shot specials. Free, 9 p.m., 21+.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/legion-brooklyn" target="_self">Legion</a>, 790 Metropolitan Ave. at Humboldt St., Williamsburg.</em><br style="clear:both;" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_19340" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevegovoni/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-19340" title="Rowayton sign" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Rowayton-sign-250x167.jpg" alt="Rowayton sign" width="250" height="167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Steve Govoni</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;d <a href="http://www.brokelyn.com/where-to-take-a-memorial-weekend-hike/" target="_self">climbed nearby mountains</a>, lit upstate <a href="http://www.brokelyn.com/a-guide-to-cheap-catskills-summer-rentals/" target="_self">cabin-fireplaces</a>&#8212;we were ready for our next summer getaway from boom-boxes and sweaty subways. This time, we day-tripped it to <a href="http://www.rowaytonct.com/" target="_self">Rowayton, Connecticut</a>, a little town on the Long Island Sound, an easy hour from the city on MetroNorth. What is Rowayton? Freaking cute is what it is. Cute as in floppy spaniels and children pulled down the street in little red wagons. Cute&#8230; but with money too, like a Norman Rockwell painting where everyone&#8217;s won the lottery. In short: everything you expect Connecticut to be.<span id="more-19011"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Getting there</strong></span> (Metro North: New Haven line: <a href="http://as0.mta.info/mnr/stations/station_detail.cfm?key=232" target="_self">Grand Central to Rowayton</a>. Off-peak round-trip: $18.50; $17.58 online)<br />
Rowayton itself is about a 20 minute walk from the train station. A left onto Rowayton Avenue and a left at the fork (onto… Rowayton   Avenue North) takes you into the center of town. Stop at the fork, though&#8212;there’s a graveyard worth visiting, where some of the tombstones date back to the 1700s.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The town</strong></span><br />
It&#8217;s easy to forget at times that Rowayton&#8217;s on the water. The weather&#8217;s cooler than inland, but some of the huge houses block the view of the private beaches that dominate the shore. The few public beaches make you wish you were a child, so they would seem more realistically proportioned.</p>
<p>The houses are great for window-counters and lovers of architecture. Many of the buildings have been standing for hundreds of years, but you wouldn’t know unless you saw the historical markers. They’ve been well kept and simply restored, so they blend with most of the other, more modern, constructions (except for the odd extremely modern example). Be prepared for balconies, beautifully painted shutters and fantastic flower gardens&#8212;as well as a couple of lobster mailboxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_19323" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/cemeteryrodeo/"><img class="size-full wp-image-19323 " title="yellowhouse" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yellowhouse.jpg" alt="Photo by caboose-rodeo" width="450" height="359" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by caboose-rodeo</p></div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><!--more-->Give yourself a self-guided history walk with the <a href="http://www.rowaytonhistoricalsociety.org/">Historical Society</a>’s  <em>Historic Rowayton</em>. The library will lend you a copy, and it will  add depth to your architectural ogling.</p>
<p>Or, if old houses aren&#8217;t your thing, Rowayton’s low,   rolling hills would make for an excellent biking location (recommended   as an easy, one-hour tour by <a href="http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=BGN020-018">trails.com</a>). MetroNorth lets you take the bike on-board.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Activities, in and out</strong></span><br />
The shore had been a major reason for our trip, but <a href="http://www.rowaytonct.com/bayleybeach.html" target="_self">Bayley    Beach</a> provided more of a chance to cool off than have a full  beach  experience. A bit of rocky sand tucked into the Sound, the Beach   features a small, buoyed swimming area that reaches the waist of most   adults. Still, the lifeguard on duty is reassuring for those with   children&#8230; and this guard lets Brokelyn readers enter free. If you’re  interested in swimming, boating, or generally enjoying the  water, check  a <a href="http://www.tides.info/?command=view&amp;location=Rowayton%2C%20Fivemile%20River%2C%20Connecticut">tide   chart</a> to help plan your trip. At low tide, almost everything will   become a huge mud flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_19337" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/myeye/"><img class="size-full wp-image-19337 " title="Usebuoys" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Usebuoys.jpg" alt="Photo by MyEyeSees" width="450" height="338" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by MyEyeSees</p></div>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For some wildlife-spotting (you are leaving the city, remember?) the <a href="http://www.farmcreek.org/" target="_self">Farm Creek Preserve</a> is the type of place where you can see three kinds of birds even before  you settle onto one of the stone benches by the water. A wonderful  place for butterflies too, the accessible  portion is a 3-acre spot at the head of the 10-acre Preserve.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rowaytonct.com/farmersmarket.html" target="_self">Rowayton Farmers&#8217; Market</a> is open every Friday, from noon to 5 in Pinkney Park. There are more than 30 weekly vendors, selling everything from chutneys and dry-rubs to recycled textiles and women&#8217;s clothing.</p>
<p>Pickney Park also is home to <a href="http://www.shakespeareonthesound.org/shakespeare_layout_1/Home.html" target="_self">Shakespeare on the Sound</a>, and annual free Shakespeare festival. Othello is this summer&#8217;s selection, but performances end July 11, so this weekend&#8217;s your last chance.</p>
<p>For music, you have two options: The <a href="http://rowaytonct.com/summermusic2010.html">RCA Summer Music Festival</a> puts on a rock, bluegrass and gypsy jazz concert on most Sundays at 5:30. And <a href="http://www.rowaytonpizza.com/" target="_self">Rowayton Pizza</a> (BYOB) hosts live music every night, from 6-10. The manager jumps in and jams to the bands, from Brazilian jazz to two local boys singing 70s covers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dining</span><br />
</strong><a href="http://www.rowaytonpizza.com/" target="_self">Rowayton Pizza</a> seems to be the hub of Rowayton late night (it closes at 10), but also the most reliable place to get filled up. Dinner entrees are usually $12-17, but you can get a sandwich, panini or calzone for $5.50-$9. The pizza is highly recommended by the locals and fairly normally priced ($14 for a 16” margherita). Don’t forget to BYOB!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_19330" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/terretta/"><img class="size-full wp-image-19330 " title="Rowaytoncar&amp;pizza" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Rowaytoncarpizza.jpg" alt="Photo by Michael Sean Terretta" width="450" height="338" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Michael Sean Terretta</p></div>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Many people stream in and out of the<strong> </strong><a href="http://rowaytonmarket.com/index.php?page=explore">Rowayton Market</a>, so their sweet patio area is the best place to people-watch. The sandwiches cost too damn much, but some of the $9 ones are bigger than your head, so they’re worth splitting. Or, consider going for one of their decadent soups, at $5 for a huge container-full. The coffee is definitely worth a sip, with a lovely house blend for $1.25/small, $1.75/large. You’ll be a bit blown away by the $3 cake selection, but don’t be too seduced. They’re trucked up from the city.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.shoprowayton.com/Site/Wine_Store.html" target="_self">Rowayton Wines and Spirits</a> (Rowayton Wine Shop)<strong> </strong>offers a predictable choice of fancy wine, but also has a few cheap gems, like a 1.5-L bottle of Rex Goliath for $10. There’s a better selection of wines under $10 than most neighborhood liquor stores, as well as 6-packs (they only sell single cans of Bud and Heineken). As the town is almost entirely BYOB, get to the liquor store before it closes at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Then there’s the <a href="http://www.rowaytonseafood.com/home.html" target="_self">fancy restaurant</a> at the <a href="http://www.rowaytonseafood.com/home.html">Rowayton Seafood Market</a>. With a parking lot spilling over with Audis and BMW’s, we took one look at the air-conditioned patio and shook our fists. They’re the only liquor-license-holders in town, but we weren’t about to spend at least $10 a glass, even for A/C. Instead, we dined on the patio tables between the restaurant and the water at the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/rowayton-seafood-fish-market-norwalk" target="_self">Seafood Market</a> itself. There&#8217;s fried fish for $10-14, oysters at $7-9/dozen, but the real jewel of this stand is the shrimp cocktail. For $1.25, you get eight 3-bite shrimp with some seriously tasty sauce. Order two, and it’s a meal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_19332" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/littlelentillil/"><img class="size-full wp-image-19332 " title="rowaytonseafood" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/rowaytonseafood.jpg" alt="View from Rowayton Seafood Market. Photo by LittleLil" width="450" height="338" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View from Rowayton Seafood Market. Photo by LittleLil</p></div>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>And for ice cream, a necessity of any summer day-trip, there’s the <a href="http://www.brendans101.com/">101</a> (at 101 Rowayton   Avenue). The food menu kinda made us wonder what a lobster omelet or filet mignon sandwich tastes like, but we tried the burger instead, which was a major disappointment. Stick to the <a href="http://www.brendans101.com/icecream.html" target="_self">frozen treats</a>, which are sweet without being overbearing, and straight from a farm ($3 for a kid’s cone, $4 for a small).</p>
<p><em>Rowayton, CT; Rowayton stop on MetroNorth&#8217;s <a href="http://as0.mta.info/mnr/stations/station_detail.cfm?key=232" target="_self">New Haven line from Grand Central</a>. $18.50 off-peak round-trip; $17.58 online.</em><br style="clear:both;" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a little difficult to recommend anything outdoors this week, but we&#8217;ll just put the stuff out there, and you gauge the risk. Tonight, Jul. 6, <a href="http://fitnessgurunyc.com/" target="_self">the Fitness Guru</a> is holding a free hour-long Pilates mat class in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The park&#8217;s <a href="http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/" target="_self">Conservancy</a> runs a <a href="http://www.brokelyn.com/bk-bridge-park-fundraiser-for-more-than-free-movies/" target="_self">slew of events and programs</a> (some of which, <a href="http://www.brokelyn.com/brooklyns-free-summer-movies-inside-out/" target="_self">you might have heard of</a>), and this is the first of the weekly Tuesday-night Pilates classes that continue through August. The 7 p.m. classes are open to all skill-levels, and they&#8217;re held at Pier 1. Registration, which is required, starts at 6:30. And you can &#8220;rent&#8221; a free mat with ID. Who knows? With the heat, it could be a private lesson. More info <a href="http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/go/programs-/-events/waterfront-workouts" target="_self">here</a>.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-19245" title="wedding presents-1" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wedding-presents-1-250x187.jpg" alt="wedding presents-1" width="250" height="187" />Summer-time means sunshine, heat, cleavage and, if you&#8217;re anywhere in a certain age-range, <a href="http://www.brokelyn.com/18-ways-to-save-on-a-brooklyn-wedding/" target="_self">weddings upon weddings</a>. Since Memorial Day weekend, the big days have been rolling out at a staggering rate (sometimes overlapping) and they&#8217;re still going strong. And once that gleaming, perfectly crafted, calligraphy-graced invitation arrives, the financial obligation begins. Because etiquette says that even if you don’t go to the wedding (or even if the couple elopes), you&#8217;ll be heading to swankyregistry.com with that $300 stand-mixer staring you in the face. But there are some creative, memorable ways to save your budget and make the happy couple even happier. <span id="more-19138"></span></p>
<p>After talking with multiple married couples and the best sources of all: parents, we&#8217;ve come up with the perfect list of options under $25 for the next time an invitation comes sailing to your door. As a warning, all of these choices are a bit more work than slapping down 25 bucks on a toaster from the registry, but they’re much more thoughtful. And you&#8217;ll feel so good giving these that it&#8217;ll be your special day too.</p>
<p><strong>Cover those wedding-day emergencies</strong><br />
No, not with flashlights and crank-radios. Make a kit with all those helpful things that   could prevent the prospective bride or groom from melting down over torn   dresses, stains or forgetful fiance(e)s. Buy a <a href="../dos-and-donts-of-99-cent-stores/" target="_self">bucket  from a 99-cent store</a>, and fill it with $24 of  whatever else you can  think of: bobby pins, a razor, clear nail polish (it  fixes everything!),  black socks, shoe polish, Tide to-go, deodorant,  comb, brush, extra  hose, tissue, toothbrush,  toothpaste, moist  towelettes, no-sew glue,  re-wetting drops, Advil, a shot of their  favorite alcohol and just for  good measure, a brown paper bag.</p>
<p><strong>Put together a pounding/recipe book</strong><br />
Pounding is something they did in the olden days: friends and family   came over and brought a pound of goods, like flour, sugar, etc., to   stock the newlyweds&#8217; kitchen. Host a Pounding Party, specify what to   bring, and include 5-10 recipe cards (there are a ton of cute ones on   Etsy like <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/typewink" target="_self">Typewink</a> ($4 for eight, but re-printable) or Brooklyn’s <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/moontreepress" target="_self">Moontree   Letterpress</a> ($12 for eight)). Everyone can bring their favorite   recipes, and then you combine them into a book (see memory books below). Get some old pictures from family to make it a little more   personal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_19249" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 399px"><img class="size-large wp-image-19249   " title="Recipe cards-1" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Recipe-cards-1-600x478.jpg" alt="Typewink recipe cards" width="389" height="310" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Typewink recipe cards</p></div>
<p><strong><!--more--></strong></p>
<p><strong>Be the party-thrower</strong><br />
This one&#8217;s good for showers, bachelor/bachelorette parties, whatever&#8212;everyone  needs a party, and throwing it can score you big points. Keep it light  and simple. Have friends over to your house, make some tea or lemonade  and leave out the alcohol to save a bit of dough. Make <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/hummus-recipe/index.html" target="_self">hummus</a> and pick up a giant $0.75 bag of pita from <a href="http://www.damascusbakery.com/" target="_self">Damascus Bakery</a> in Cobble Hill. Get your friends to bring something small as well, and  you can all put in $15-$20 toward a nicer gift.</p>
<p><strong>Make them Mr. &amp; Mrs. fix-it</strong><br />
Here’s something a man can give and feel manly about (strip clubs cost a     hell of a lot more than $25… from what we hear). Everyone needs   tools,   and every neighborhood has a hardware store. At <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sisters-community-hardware-store-llc-brooklyn" target="_self">Sisters  Community Hardware</a> in Clinton Hill, you can    get a full tool kit,  with a hammer, two screwdrivers, a tape   measure   and pliers for $20. Or  pick out the items yourself (hammers:  $6-$11,   pliers: $5-$12,  screwdrivers: $4-$13. Throw in a level for  that   level-headed marriage  too ($13). Steer clear of 99-cent stores  for this   one.</p>
<div id="attachment_19252" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 423px"><img class="size-full wp-image-19252" title="toolscrop" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/toolscrop.jpg" alt="toolscrop" width="413" height="329" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Julia Manzerova</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong><!--more--></strong></p>
<p><strong>Share your memories</strong> <strong>of the big day</strong><br />
Everyone has a wedding album, but there&#8217;s only so much the newly-weds   can fit into that one book. Give them a second one, full of wedding-day   memories from your perspective. There are a lot of great sites that   print books, from <a href="http://www.blurb.com/" target="_self">Blurb</a> (books start  at $12.95, with $6.99 flat rate shipping), to <a href="http://www.shutterfly.com/" target="_self">Shutterfly</a> (books  start at $11). Or of course, you  can slap it together yourself. <a href="../good-deal-hunting-amazing-savings/" target="_self">Amazing Savings</a> in Midwood has an awesome   scrap-booking section.</p>
<p><strong><img title="More..." src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" />Keep the marriage spicy</strong><br />
Spices can be expensive. Similar to the Pounding, this is a good way to  help stock a kitchen. Get creative and buy some cheap Indian or  Pakistani spices from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=zaitoon+coney+island+avenue&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=zaitoon&amp;hnear=Coney+Island+Ave,+NY&amp;cid=16577397421837070642" target="_self">Zaitoon</a> in Brooklyn&#8217;s <a href="../bargains-galore-in-pakistan-nyc/" target="_self">Little Pakistan</a>: 7-oz. bags of Garam Masala, curry,  turmeric, ginger and every other spice you can imagine go for  $1.79-$1.99. For the spiciest couples, a 14-oz. bag of extra hot chili  pepper runs $3.99. If you&#8217;re going the Chinese route, <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2010/02/where-to-buy-chinese-ingredients-in-new-york-city-sunset-park-chinatown-flushing-queens-manhattan-brooklyn.html" target="_self">Serious Eats</a> has a fantastic guide. A small herb garden is a nice idea too. Include an aloe  plant for burns&#8212;it’s easy to take care of and regenerates itself. You  can find fresh herbs all over Brooklyn at <a href="../brooklyn-csas-so-you-dont-miss-a-beet/" target="_self">greenmarkets</a> and nurseries.</p>
<div id="attachment_19248" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 415px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohitrath/3735160243/"><img class="size-full wp-image-19248  " title="spices" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/spices.jpg" alt="spices" width="405" height="272" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Rohit Rath</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong><!--more--></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Offer your services</strong><br />
Our parents are right: we’re all good at something&#8230; so we all have something to give our friends for the most important day of their lives. Offer to make the cake, record the wedding, quilt a blanket of pictures for friends to sign (sounds weird but is very cute!). Find some free pretty fabric to re-use or choose a snazzy sale pattern for under $5 at <a href="http://www.sew-materialistic.com/" target="_self">Sew Materialistic</a> in Borough Park.</p>
<p><strong>Round out the registry</strong><br />
Look at the registry, find an item that has already been purchased, and  buy something to go with it. If someone bought a nice coffee-maker, buy  some local coffee, like <a href="http://gorillacoffee.com/" target="_self">Gorilla Coffee</a> ($11.99/lb) or <a href="http://www.croptocup.com/" target="_self">Crop to Cup</a> ($8.99/lb), and throw in a few cute coffee mugs. Obviously, don’t buy  bread for a toaster&#8212;try to be creative! Once again, <a href="../good-deal-hunting-amazing-savings/" target="_self">Amazing Savings</a> is a good bet. Scour the registry and  see what brand they chose for their cookware, and find the same brand  for cheaper. If they buy a 10-piece cooking set, buy them an extra  frying pan.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure the honeymoon romance</strong><br />
Some people are more worried about the after-wedding than during it, so    why not ease their concerns? Now, don’t be crude: We&#8217;re talking about    making a little package with a bottle of Prosecco (<a href="http://www.gnarlyvines.com/" target="_self">Gnarly Vines</a> in  Fort Greene has a mini bottle for only $4.50, with a twist off  top!),   two champagne glasses (disposable ones from Party City work), a  <a href="../a-dusty-musty-guide-to-brooklyns-used-bookstores/" target="_self">book of Keats or Wilde</a> and, ok, throw in a few  condoms too, of   the free <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/condoms/condoms.shtml" target="_self">NYC variety</a>. Although your friends might never    admit it, they’ll appreciate the thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19247" title="NYC condom-1crop" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/NYC-condom-1crop.jpg" alt="NYC condom-1crop" width="432" height="340" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong><!--more--></strong></p>
<p>And to wrap it all up? There&#8217;s nothing wrong with paper bags or Christmas paper turned inside-out&#8230; as long as it&#8217;s not too tacky.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your best under-$25 wedding gift idea?<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

Here&#8217;s what we found last summer, one hot August afternoon:</em></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s the first day this year that the city has opened its <a href="http://gis.nyc.gov/oem/cc/index.htm" target="_self">cooling  centers</a>, the specially designated air-conditioned havens where  heat-addled New Yorkers can go for a breather. On this 92-degree day,  our family seemed to be hitting the limits of a no-AC summer—inspired by  equal parts cheapness, bravado and child cruelty—so my 6-year-old son  and I packed up bag lunches and headed to the nearest chilling station.<span id="more-19264"></span></p>
<p>As it happens, the <a href="http://dorchesterseniors.blogspot.com/" target="_self">Dorchester  Senior Center</a>, tucked into the basement of an Orthodox synagogue,  is a cheerful little place. It has a chatty atmosphere where people tend  to cluster at tables with their ethnic ilk (Asian, Russian,  African-American and so forth). I am disappointed when we are assigned  to dine by ourselves, and our attempts to bridge the gap between tables  are only intermittently successful (though we do learn that baked  chicken legs—Wednesday—is a favorite.) <img title="More..." src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6892" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px;" title="senior-center-sign" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/senior-center-sign-250x187.jpg" alt="senior-center-sign" width="250" height="187" />Even though we have  our own food, the Russian lunch lady insists on serving us today&#8217;s meal:  a tuna scoop, a baked potato, salad, cantaloupe triangle, pineapple  juice and two pieces of rye bread with butter. She doesn&#8217;t ask for IDs  or charge us. A sign invites diners to pay $1 for lunch but says nobody  over 60 will be turned away for non-payment. If you&#8217;re under 60, lunch  goes up to $2.50 on a non-cooling-center day, the director informs us  later. Breakfast is only 25 cents, but it doesn&#8217;t sound fancy: just  coffee, tea, bread, jam and butter.<!--more--></p>
<p>Food-wise, and air-conditioning-wise, the afternoon is a success  (wilted salad aside), and my son would be content to stay until the  place closes at 4, despite a total absence of kids&#8217; activities.  Socially, though, it probably takes a while to break in. We were the  only ones there for cooling purposes, and most folks here seem to be  regulars who know each other from the knitting groups, walking clubs and  boisterous mah jongg games the center sponsors. When we take out our  Pokemon cards, several people pause by the table and smile but nobody  takes the step of joining in.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s okay, because we&#8217;ll be back, possibly on Wednesday for baked  chicken. On the way out, we learn that the place has a wireless router.  Wonder how the coffee is.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_19230" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/90124154@N00/3298237457/#/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-19230" title="revolutionary picnic" src="http://www.brokelyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/revolutionary-picnic-250x177.jpg" alt="Photo by Seuss." width="250" height="177" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Seuss.</p></div>
<p>It’s a couple&#8230; 234 years later, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t do this thing right. Brooklyn has a <a href="http://www.brooklynonline.com/history/battle.xhtml" target="_self">hallowed place</a> in our country&#8217;s early days. This July 4, take part in some historically (in)appropriate activities to celebrate our founding fathers, freedom and plain, old 18th century good times. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>
<p><strong>1) Drive out your British neighbors</strong>&#8230; to pick up some Sam  Adams,    that is. (Who do you think we are?)<span id="more-19216"></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Give your fox-hounds the day off. </strong>Bring them to the <a href="http://www.fidobrooklyn.org/features/dogbeach.html" target="_self">Prospect Park dog beach</a> instead. Who knows? Maybe  they&#8217;ll catch something for the grill.</p>
<p><strong>3) Dress like you mean it:</strong> Trade your summer dress for a 10-layer <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_qbaZcOzp8Xg/SSrWiaiVb8I/AAAAAAAAAJg/gdsfKJa3ZTc/robe+a+la+francaise+back+webP1020824.jpg" target="_self">sack-back gown</a>: Nothing screams sexy like a closed   bodice and flowery ribbons. For the guys, take out your best formal wig   (lest you get labeled a mere commoner).</p>
<p><strong>4) Throw your own tea party:</strong> First stop, Tea Lounge. Next, the Gowanus Canal. You pick the cause.</p>
<p><strong>5) Host a bathtub gin party</strong> to honor prohibition&#8217;s roots.</p>
<p><strong>6) Hold a dance dance revolution:</strong> Show off your best <a href="http://www.colonialmusic.org/Resource/howtoCOT.htm" target="_self">Cotillion</a> at the BBQ ball.</p>
<p><strong>7) Bake your own hotdog buns</strong>. Don’t forget the <a href="http://www.hms.org.uk/nelsonsnavymaggot.htm" target="_self">maggots and weevils</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8) Throw together some <a href="http://www.chow.com/recipes/10197-grog" target="_self">grog</a> for the festivities:</strong> If it doesn&#8217;t arouse your gag reflex, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>9) Quiet down the rowdies:</strong> Save those illegal fireworks for next year and go for the Revolutionary cannon (complete with <a href="http://www.ambroseantiques.com/cannons/largerev.htm" target="_self">eight-pound cannonballs</a>) instead. A lot more bad-ass, and guaranteed to terrify everyone within a half-mile of your rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>10) Witness a modern-day Battle of Brooklyn&#8230; </strong>just with <a href="http://nymag.com/realestate/neighborhoods/2010/65356/" target="_self">different-color coats</a>.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

If you&#8217;ve been saving everything of junior&#8217;s out of an over-developed sense of sentimentality, we understand&#8230; really, we do. But this is your big chance to get a little in return, because the next stop for this stuff might just be Goodwill. And Monk&#8217;s Trunk will even <a href="http://ditmasparkblog.com/news/monks-trunk" target="_self">pick it all up</a>.<span id="more-19180"></span></p>
<p>Carrie McLaren (of <a href="http://www.hawthornestreet.com/" target="_self">Hawthorne Street</a> fame), is behind the store-to-be, and she&#8217;s looking for used clothing for fall and winter (girls and boys up to size 8), books,  baby carriers, shoes, DVDs and toys &amp; puzzles with all the pieces. The clothing must be clean and in excellent condition, and the store&#8217;s especially interested in premium basics (Gap) and boutique labels (Tea Collection, European brands, etc.).</p>
<p>Come this fall, Monk’s Trunk will be located near the Q/B trains at Parkside. To make an appointment for pick-up, call Carrie at 718-398-9324 or email her at brooklynite282@gmail.com.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

<p><em><em>This is the latest in our series on the venues featured in the Brokelyn Beer Book. The Charleston in Williamsburg is a Brokester&#8217;s dream: a pizza comes with every beer.</em></em></p>
<p id="the_charleston"><em><strong>THE CHARLESTON<br />
</strong><em>174 Bedford Ave. between N. 7th and N. 8th Sts., Williamsburg,  718-782-8717</em></em></p>
<p><em><strong>What it is: </strong>About as rough and tumble as a bar with gorgeous  handmade tables and black-shuttered windows overlooking Bedford Avenue  can be.<br />
<strong>Why we love it: </strong>It&#8217;s the cheap-o haven that doesn&#8217;t feel like a  cheap-o haven. Drinks come with a whole personal pizza.<br />
<strong>Who to bring: </strong>People watchers, those friends who love to try to  eat until they puke, a friendly partner to facilitate sharing a table  with strangers on a weekend night.<br />
<strong>What to order: </strong>Beer and pizza. Period. Make sure there&#8217;s parmesan  and red pepper at hand.<br />
<strong>Charleston fun fact: </strong>It&#8217;s one of the longest-standing bars in  Williamsburg.</em><br style="clear:both;" /></p>
