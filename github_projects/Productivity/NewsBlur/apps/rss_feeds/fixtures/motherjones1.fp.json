In the last year alone, he braved tear gas and live fire in <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/01/whats-happening-egypt-explained" target="_blank">Egypt</a>, was <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/02/whats-happening-libya-explained" target="_blank">kidnapped by Qaddafi\'s thugs in Libya</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/magazine/syrias-sons-of-no-one.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">secretly traversed Syria\'s killing fields</a> by motorcycle. <em>House of Stone</em> casts the correspondent in a softer light, recalling his 2007 return to his ancestral village in southern Lebanon to rebuild his great-grandfather\'s abandoned home&mdash;and perhaps piece together his own wayward life in the process. At once outsider and native son, Shadid elegantly reflects on the violent splintering of the once-vibrant Levant and its uphill struggle to reclaim its dwindling notions of regional identity.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Editor\'s Note</em></strong><em>: </em>Anthony Shadid <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/world/middleeast/anthony-shadid-a-new-york-times-reporter-dies-in-syria.html" target="_blank">died of an asthma attack</a> in February while reporting for the <em>New York Times </em>inside Syria. Shortly before his death, he spoke with <em>Mother Jones</em> about <em>House of Stone</em>, Syria\'s future, and the high cost of getting the story in a war zone. <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2012/01/anthony-shadid-libya-syria-house-of-stone" target="_blank">You can read Shadid\'s interview with <em>Mother Jones</em> here</a>.</p>\n\n<div class="service-links"><span><a href="http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmotherjones.com%2Fmixed-media%2F2012%2F03%2Freview-anthony-shadid-house-stone-memoir&amp;title=Book+Review%3A+House+of+Stone" id="service-links-digg-17" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Digg this post on digg.com"><img alt="Digg" height="16" src="http://motherjones.com/sites/all/modules/patched/service_links/images/digg.png" title="" width="16" /></a>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmotherjones.com%2Fmixed-media%2F2012%2F03%2Freview-anthony-shadid-house-stone-memoir&amp;t=Book+Review%3A+House+of+Stone" id="service-links-facebook-17" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share on Facebook."><img alt="Facebook" height="16" src="http://motherjones.com/sites/all/modules/patched/service_links/images/facebook.png" title="" width="16" /></a>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmotherjones.com%2Fmixed-media%2F2012%2F03%2Freview-anthony-shadid-house-stone-memoir&amp;title=Book+Review%3A+House+of+Stone" id="service-links-reddit-17" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Submit this post on reddit.com."><img alt="Reddit" height="16" src="http://motherjones.com/sites/all/modules/patched/service_links/images/reddit.png" title="" width="16" /></a>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmotherjones.com%2Fmixed-media%2F2012%2F03%2Freview-anthony-shadid-house-stone-memoir&amp;title=Book+Review%3A+House+of+Stone" id="service-links-stumbleupon-17" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thumb this up at StumbleUpon"><img alt="StumbleUpon" height="16" src="http://motherjones.com/sites/all/modules/patched/service_links/images/stumbleit.png" title="" width="16" /></a>&nbsp;</span></div>'},
