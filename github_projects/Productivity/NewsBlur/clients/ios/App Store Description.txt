NewsBlur is a free visual RSS feed reader. 

NOTE: You must already have a free account on www.newsblur.com. This iPhone app is an accessory to the website.

Features:

1) Train stories based on tags, keywords, authors, etc.
2) Highlights stories you want to read.
3) Hides stories you don't want to read.

NewsBlur is a very original take on RSS feed reading. It's also being built by a sole indie developer as open-source software: http://github.com/samuelclay.
