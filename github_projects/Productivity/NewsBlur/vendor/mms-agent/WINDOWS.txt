Install Prerequisites
---------------------
* Install python 2.7.x using the Windows Installer. 64 bit installer is preferred. 
e.g. http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.amd64.msi
* Install latest version of pymongo using the Windows Installer from pypi. Ensure 
you pick the installer that corresponds to your python version and the type (32 bit or 64 bit).
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/

Install Powershell 2.0
----------------------
* If you do not have powershell 2.0 installed you would need to install it from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968929.

Enable Powershell Script Execution
----------------------------------
* Open the Windows Powershell by right-clicking its icon in the Start bar and selecting Run as Administrator
* Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` and agree when prompted about changing the policy

Specifying a Proxy Server
-------------------------
If the MMS agent needs a proxy server to connect outside, specify it in the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable
 as http://proxyservername:port

Sevice Installation
-------------------
* The script reads python path from windows registry if not specified on command line
* If multiple python installations are present edit the bat file to specify the path of the python install to work
* Run mongommsinstall.bat from an administrator command window
* This will install the windows service and start it
* If you stop the windows service, the agent will stop

Uninstall
---------
- Stop the "MongoDB MMS" windows service
- Run "sc delete mongomms"
