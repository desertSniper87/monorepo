Description: This module implements a very fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python.
        
        JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a text based lightweight
        data exchange format which is easy for humans to read/write and for machines
        to parse/generate. JSON is completely language independent and has multiple
        implementations in most of the programming languages, making it ideal for
        data exchange and storage.
        
        The module is written in C and it is up to 250 times faster when compared to
        the other python JSON implementations which are written directly in python.
        This speed gain varies with the complexity of the data and the operation and
        is the the range of 10-200 times for encoding operations and in the range of
        100-250 times for decoding operations.
        
        This module is an enhanced version of the original python-cjson 1.0.3.

        New feature not in the original 1.0.3 release:
        
        Encoder and decoder functions are extensible to allow conversion of objects
        not in the official JSON specification, such as Date objects.
        
        Unicode and character encoding related enhancements. Automatic conversion
        of dictionary keys to strings (JSON requires string keys in objects).
