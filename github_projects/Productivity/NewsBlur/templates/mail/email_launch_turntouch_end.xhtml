<h3 style="margin: 24px 0;">This is it, the final countdown!</h3>

<p>Tonight at 8pm PT the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/">Turn Touch campaign</a> will end and the project will be successfully funded. Judging from the $50,000 raised already, I think Turn Touch has a long life ahead of it.</p>

<p>Apart from being the only remote control in the world built for a news reader, Turn Touch is the handiest shortcut for your lights, music, and apps. It's basically a customizable remote with a knack for smart homes.</p>

<p>Supporting Turn Touch is a way of supporting NewsBlur. They are part of the same suite of productivity tools made by the <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelclay">same person</a>. By buying a Turn Touch and backing this Kickstarter, you're continuing to fund the development of great tools.</p>

<p>So please <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/">head to Kickstarter and buy yourself the $59 mahogany remote</a>, even if you do not yet have any smart home devices. This remote is the easiest way to start connecting your home.</p>
