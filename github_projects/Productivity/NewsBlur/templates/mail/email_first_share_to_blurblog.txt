{% block body %}Your shared story is now on your Blurblog

You can view your Blurblog here: {{ blurblog_url }}

Your Blurblog also has an RSS feed: {{ blurblog_rss }}

{% if shared_stories > 1 %}You've already shared {{ shared_stories }} stories, but you may not have known that your shared stories are on your Blurblog.{% else %}You just shared your first story on NewsBlur. All of your shared stories are available on your Blurblog.{% endif %}

This is a personal website made for you that you can customize. You can also share out links to your blurblog, where friends and followers can reply and re-share your stories.

Blurblogs were built so you would have a way to share stories with people who aren't on NewsBlur and don't want to load the entire reader just to read and comment on your shared stories.{% endblock body %}
