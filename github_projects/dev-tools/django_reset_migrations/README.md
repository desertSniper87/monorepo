# Django reset migrations

Add one command to reset the django migrations.

Sometimes you have one app that had a lot migrations in development process.
And this migrations could be deleted, because anybody will need this in the future.

Soo, could be stressfull delete the files, reset the database and create the first
migration again ... to start to developer again and bla bla bla ...

Because this, I made this command to reset the migrations and start the first migration.
